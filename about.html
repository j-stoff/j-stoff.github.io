                    <p>I originally had the idea to go to college the full four years, go to medical school, and work toward becoming a neurologist. To that end, I studied Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin - Madison and got my Bachelor's of Science in 2014. After college, I decided to pursue a job in the healthcare field in order to see if it was a good fit for me.</p>

                    <p>Toward the end of my second year, I questioned if continuing on in medicine was a good decision. I decided to take a few programming courses at Madison College (then called Madison Area Technical College) which I found very interesting and quite rewarding. At the end of 2016, I quit my job in order to pursue a full time education as a programmer.</p>

                    <p>Being a 'programmer' is quite vague as that can describe even individuals not related to any IT field at all. To that end, I also enrolled at University of Wisconsin - Madison with the intent to get a Certificate (similar to a Minor at other colleges) in Computer Science.</p>

                    <p>So I began learning the new and trendy techniques, frameworks, and design ideas at Madison College while getting the old school Computer Science monologue about bits, segementation faults in C, and what an operating system really is.</p>

                    <p>I am still quite new to coding, but I learn very quickly. I do have a tendency to try tackling problems I am not yet ready for. For example, my Next Book project was the culmination of roughly a semester's worth of work. My instructor suggested to use filler data in order to provide the required functionality for the course. Instead I actually tried (somewhat successfully) to build a web application that predicts book suggestions based on a user's reading history. That means I needed book data which I scraped from goodreads.com which was a completely unneeded part of the project though any Machine Learning needs data in order to predict anything (though I really needed user data instead of book data). In the end, I wound up with a somewhat viable application that would give a decent book prediction based on other user's ratings. My project would have turned out much better if I did not take a detour to use Machine Learning and wrangle with <i>real</i> data. I vastly underestimated the work involved in manipulating thousands of records.</p>

                    <h4 class="subject-header">Everything else</h4>

                    <p>I am an avid gamer and have been throughout my life. I grew up playing WarCraft III and StarCraft: Brood War which are still my favorite games to date. In college I played Starcraft II somewhat competitively and even managed to get some winnings at a few tournaments.</p>

                    <p>Reading has also been a passion of mine, as I have read many titles from the fantasy, sci-fi, and supernatural genres. Anything from Butcher, Sanderson, Tolkien, to Stephen King. Any recommendations are welcomed. This was also the inspiration for my Next Book project.</p>
