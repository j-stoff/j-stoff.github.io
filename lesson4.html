                <h4>More clarification on previous code</h4>
                <p>Now we will look at writing our own class definitions. For now, ignore the scope definition (public) for the moment.</p>
                <p>As you probably guessed, 'class' in the class definition is create a class of the given name.</p>
                <pre><code>
                    public class ExampleClass {
                        //Code here
                    }
                </code></pre>

                <h4>Onto something new - Variables</h4>
                <p>How do you add variables to a class?</p>
                <p>For now, the same way to declaring as a method works. Though there is a better way, more on that later.</p>
                <p>Using the same class as before:</p>
                <pre><code>
                    public class ExampleClass {
                        int lessonsCompeteled;
                        boolean doingTheAssignments;
                    }
                </code></pre>


                <h4>Now the good stuff: Methods</h4>
                <p>Variables are nice, but they only store things. Useful for later on, but databases are for storage, programs are supposed to do something.</p>
                <p>Jumping right into it</p>
                <pre><code>
                    public void myMethod(String user) {
                        // Code here
                    }
                </code></pre>
                <p>This is a full method declaration. Though the access modifier is not needed, one is used almost always.</p>
                <p>The next field is for the return type. It can be a primitive, Object type, or void which returns nothing.</p>
                <p>Next is the name for the method. Again, convention has camel case beginning with a smaller case letter and capitalizing new words. The more descriptive the method, the better.</p>
                <p>The parentheis are for arguments. When declaraing parameters, the type is needed as well as a local name to be used within the method. In the example above, a String is a parameter with the name 'user'.</p>
                <p>Parameters are not optional, but aren't always handled correctly within methods. Be careful what is passed to a method is what it should be.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the curly braces contain the code to execute for the method.</p>

                <h4>Why even put things into classes?</h4>
                <p>Code reusability. It's that simple. Well written code can be re-used very frequently with little overhead to the developer.</p>

                <h4>Scope</h4>
                <p>For now I have been ignoring the 'public' declarations as well as static defitions as they deal with scope.</p>
                <p>We will tackle these in the future, but for the moment everything is scoped within the context it was declared.</p>
                <p>For example, a variable made in a method will survive the duration of the method. A variable declared within a class is usable as long as the reference to the class is active.</p>
                 <pre><code>
                    public class ExampleClass {
                        int lessonsCompeteled;
                        boolean doingTheAssignments;
                        
                        public void myMethod(String user) {
                            // Some cool code
                            int big;
                        }
                    }
                </code></pre>
                <p>Using the example above. What is the scope for 'doingTheAssignments'? What about 'big' within myMethod?</p>

                <h4>Creating class refences</h4>
                <p>The majority of the variables will be references to pre-made classes as they have greater functionality than primitives.</p>
                <p>To create a class use the 'new' keyword then the class name with parenthesis. Similar to a function call.</p>
                <pre><code>
                    ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
                </code></pre>
                <p>The parenthesis actually calls the 'constructor' which is something we will get to soon.</p>

                <p>Note: Strings do not require a 'new' keyword for each string.</p>
                <pre><code>
                    String name = "bob";
                </code></pre>

                <h4>Exercise - Cars</h4>
                    <p>Create a class called Car</p>
                    <p>Give the Car class 3 variables.</p>
                    <p>The VIN (vehicle id number) as a string.</p>
                    <p>The car type as a String.</p>
                    <p>An int with number of miles.</p>
                    <p>Create a method called carFacts() that prints all variables to the console.</p>
                    <p>Create your own runner class (class with main method, use others as examples).</p>
                    <p>Create a reference to a Car Object in the runner.
                    Call the carFacts() method. Compile and execute.</p>
