                    <h3 class="topic-header">Scope</h3>
                    <p>By now, the 'public' keyword has been used quite a bit with no explanation.</p>
                    <p>'public' is known as an <span class="emphasize">Access Modifier</span> as it declares how the information can be accessed.</p>
                        <h4 class="subject-header">Public</h4>
                    <p>Public is the simplest example. Anyone and anything can access public variables and methods.</p>
                        <h4 class="subject-header">Protected</h4>
                    <p>Protected indicates that only classes that inherit from the class hierarchy can access these methods and variables.</p>
                        <h4 class="subject-header">Private</h4>
                    <p>Private is the strictest as only the class has access to the these variables and methods.</p>
                        <h4 class="subject-header">Default</h4>
                    <p>The basic privelege given if no access modifier is given. Not as strict as protected but not as open as public.</p>
                    <p>Note: <span class="emphasize">All instance variables</span> should be declared as private. The reasoning is that the variables should not be changed unless through accepted means (see getters/setters)</p>
                    <p>Having private instance variables increases security as the only way to access the variable is through methods the developer has written.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Getters and Setters</h3>
                        <p>As I said above, the convention for java is that all instance variables of a class are declared as 'private' meaning only the class has access.</p>

                        <p>That might seem rather limiting as other things might need the information within those variables.</p>

                        <p>Here is where a get/set methods come into play. Commonly called getter/setters.</p>

                        <p>The idea behind getters is to return the current value within the variable. A setter assigns the variable to a new value.</p>

<pre>
<code>
private int myAge;

public int getMyAge() {
    return this.myAge;
}

public void setMyAge(int diffAge) {
    myAge = diffAge;
}

</code>
</pre>

                    <p>Lets analyze the code example above. First an integer is declared called 'myAge'. This is private access meaning only the class knows about it.</p>

                    <p>
                        Next is the <span class="emphasize">Getter</span>
                        method. It is public and returns an int which is the current value of 'myAge'.
                        Note the use of 'this' keyword. 'this' refers to the class which the code is a part of.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally the <span class="emphasize">Setter</span> method. Again it is public but has no return value. Unlike the getter, it has one parameter that will be assigned to the variable.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="subject-header">What is the point?</h4>
                    <p>Couldn't the variables just be default? Or even public.</p>
                    <p>The answer is yes, but that would be a big security flaw as well as bad pracitice. The reason being, anyone using the code with a little knowledge could change the variables very easily with simple assignment.</p>
                    <p>Getters and Setters provide a way that if the programmer wants to alter how the variable is accessed or changed, that it is done so in a specific way so the class doesn't screw up.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Constructor</h3>
                    <p>On the subject of skipped topics. The 'new' keyword when declaring a class as well as the reason for parenthesis isn't clear quite yet.</p>
                    <p>The reason is that the 'new' keyword combined with a class's name and parenthesis calls a <span class="emphasize">constructor</span>.</p>

                    <h4 class="subject-header">What is a constructor</h4>
                    <p>A constructor is a method that creates an instance of the class (itself) to return.</p>

<pre>
<code>
public File() {
    // Initialization code
}
</code>
</pre>

                    <p>Constructors serve to initialize code within a class. For example, if there are some variables that are Objects, they need to be created so they are not null.</p>

                    <p>Notice above, the constructor has no parameters which is called a <span class="emphasize"> No Arg constructor or Empty constructor</span>. It is good practice to put one of these in regardless of other constructors.</p>
                    <h4>But wait, if a class needs a constructor, how did the code run before.</h4>
                    <p>The JVM is smart, it figures out that if a constructor isn't declared that a no-arg constructor is assumed which will work in all cases for the class.</p>
                    <p>The downside to having a smart JVM is that if any other type of constructor is declared, that is it. That is why it is common to have a No-Arg constructor as well as other constructors that are for convience.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Overloading and Overriding. What are they?</h3>
                    <p>I mentioned above that a class can have several types of constructors. How is that possible? How does the JVM know which constructor to use?</p>
                    <h4>The answer is Overloading</h4>
                    <p><span class="emphasize">Overloading</span> is when a method or constructor has multiple definitions that have different parameter requirements but preform the same action and return the same type.</p>

<pre>
<code>
// No Arg constructor
public File() {
}

public File(String fileName) {
    // Do something
}
</code>
</pre>

                    <p>In the example above, the default no-argument constructor is present with no parameters at all. Another constructor takes a String for a given file name.</p>

                    <h4 class="subject-header">So what is Overriding?</h4>
                    <p>Overriding is actually very different, but still deals with methods.</p>
                    <p><span class="emphasize">Overriding</span> deals with inheriting a method from a class and rewriting it to suit the sub-class.</p>
                    <p>Recall the Dog example which inherited from Animal class. Animal had an eat() method that had a simple print statement. Well, the Dog class needs to eat() as well but would be exactly like any other Animal class.</p>

                    <p>Adding an Override would tell the JVM, oh that method I inherited, yeah I want to change that to this definition here.</p>

<pre>
<code>
// Note the @ is an annotation symbol
@Override
public void eat() {
System.out.println("Bark, I like bacon");
}
</code>
</pre>
                    <p>Note: The @ symbol is for a Java annotation. Annotations can be used for many things and are becoming more popular. Sufficed to say, @ is needed with Override or the JVM has no idea what you are trying to do.</p>
