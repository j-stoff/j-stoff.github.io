# Repository for my github.io site.
A GitHub page I use for centralizing my ideas.

The index page is just a general description of the site.
I also included a resume link which is an html version of my current resume, a TODO tab of things I would like to learn about, a resources page with links to several thousand code references, and an About page to describe myself. Finally, I have used it to demonstrate some code examples such as my jQuery TicTacToe plugin.


The entire site is in HTML and CSS at the moment, but I may convert to using Jekyll when I dive into Ruby as this would be a much easier way to manage a website.
