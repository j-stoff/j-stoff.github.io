            <div class="content">
                <h4>Taking a look at the HelloWorld.java in a text editor, some of the words should seem familiar.</h4>
                <p>For example: "public class HelloWorld {}" is the full class declaration</p>
                <p>In it, the code is saying I have a class called 'HelloWorld' that is for public use.</p>
                <p>Additionally, inside the class is the main method 'public static void main(String args[])' is how to declare a method that the JVM looks for.</p>
                <p>Finally, within the code is 'System.out.println()' which has a String as a parameter.</p>
                <p>Analyzing the last portion, the meaning is that there is a System object that Java knows about, it has a field called out for standard output, and a method called 'println' which can take almost any arguement and print it to the console <i>with</i> a carriage return and new line feed.</p>

                <h4>Now you should be able to run and compile Java code.</h4>
                <p>Note: the file name and the class within the file must match or the compiler will throw an error. This is always true and why version control can be a pain sometimes.</p>
                <p>Note: This is also why Java class names are capitalized and use camel case as a standard because the compiler doesn't care if a class begins with a lower case; it just makes sure the file name matches the class name.</p>

                <h4>That should have been fairly easy, so onto actually writing some code.</h4>
                <p>First thing would be to know about Java Data types as there are only two - primitives and pointers to objects. The first, primitives, are classically what you might think of as variables, integers, characters, boolean values are all primitives. The other, object references (pointers as I have been calling them), represent the vast majority of variable types used. Even String is an object, not a primitive.</p>

                <p>A full list of primitives is below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>boolean</li>
                    <li>int</li>
                    <li>short</li>
                    <li>char</li>
                    <li>float</li>
                    <li>double</li>
                    <li>long</li>
                    <li>byte</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Onto another topic: Operators</h4>
                <p>Operators are present in all languages I know of though sometimes in different forms. They are very similar to mathematical operators with some variations.</p>

                <p>The list of common operators in Java:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>=   is the operator for assignment</li>
                    <li>+   is for mathematical addition or string concatenation</li>
                    <li>-   is for subtraction</li>
                    <li>*   is for multiplication</li>
                    <li>/   is for division</li>
                    <li>%   is the modulus which returns the remainder</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The order of operation is at a default from left to right. Multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction. Assignment is one of the lowest predences.</p>

                <p>Note: there are other operators, such as ++ or ?</p>
                <p>Additionally, some of these operators can be combined, such as += which will add first the value on the right to the variable then assign it to itself.</p>
                <p>A more explicit definition of above would be: x = x + 1, is the same as x += 1</p>

                <h4>Logical Operators</h4>
                <p>The logical operators return true if the evaluated statement is true or false if it is not.</p>
                <p>For example <span class="emphasize">3 > 2</span> would return <b>true</b>. While <span class="emphasize">3 < 2</span> would be <b>false</b>.</p>
                <p>Additionally, there is also <span class="emphasize">>=</span> for greater than or equal to, and <span class="emphasize"><=</span> for less than or equal to.</p>
                <p>Judging equality is with <span class="emphasize">==</span></p>
                <p>Note, all of these ONLY WORK FOR PRIMITIVES. Comparing objects is done with the .equals() method.</p>


                <h4>Declaring variables</h4>
                <p>Java is a strongly typed language meaning that the 'type' of the variable must be declared when the variable is declared.</p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <p>int index;</p>
                <p>Simply declares an integer called index for further use.</p>
                <p>Other examples:</p>
                <p>double bigNumber;</p>
                <p>boolean didItWork;</p>

                <p>Note for chars: Chars must use single quotes when declaring a single character. Double quotes indicates a string. The converse isn't always true as 'this is a string' is a string.</p>

                <p>Next, assignment of the variable to an initial value can take place in one step</p>
                <p>int index = 10;</p>
                <p>The index value starts at 10 instead of 0 (that is where integers begin).</p>
                <p>It is a good idea to explicitly initialize variables in order to avoid silly mistakes.</p>
                <p>Side note, when using numbers, typically only use integers and doubles. Floats, longs, and shorts have specific use cases for memory preformance but the difference between a 16 bit float versus a 32 bit double is not much. Changing a bunch of code from a float to a double would be.</p>

                <h4>Assignment</h4>
                <p>Declare 4 variables</p>
                <p>Two integers called numberOne and numberTwo</p>
                <p>A boolean value set to false</p>
                <p>Finally, a String initialized with your name (eg: String name = "Bob")</p>

                <p>With your variables, called three print statements.</p>
                <p>The first, call numberOne > numberTwo as a parameter</p>
                <p>Second call the boolean value</p>
                <p>Third, use String concatenation to combine "My name is: " with your 'name' variable.</p>
