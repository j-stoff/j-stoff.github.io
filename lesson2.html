                    <h4>Taking a look at the HelloWorld.java in a text editor, some of the words should seem familiar. For example, public and class are certainly easy to understand but have a very specific meaning in Java. Such words are called <span class="emphasize">keywords</span>. Keywords can not be used as names for variables, methods, or classes as these words are used by the compiler to indicate different things during compilation.</h4>
<pre>
<code>
public class HelloWorld {}
</code>
</pre>
                    <p>The above is a valid class declaration (though not very useful)</p>
                    <p>In it, the code is saying I have a class called 'HelloWorld' that is for public use.</p>
<pre>
<code>
public static void main(String args[]) {}
</code>
</pre>
                    <p>Above is the main method for almost every java program, something the JVM looks for in order to excute code.</p>
<pre>
<code>
System.out.println();
</code>
</pre>
                    <p>Analyzing the last portion, the meaning is that there is a System Object that Java knows about, it has a field called out for standard output (the .out), and a method called 'println' which can take almost any arguement and print it to the console <i>with</i> a carriage return and new line feed.</p>
                    <p>This is one of the most important debugging tools to come across, though make sure to take it out when finalizing the code.</p>
                    <p>Also important to note, Java is based on C meaning each line ends with a semi-colon or curly brace. NO EXCEPTIONS.</p>

                    <h4>After running the HelloWorld program, compiling and running code is that simple.</h4>
                    <p>Note: the file name and the class within the file must match or the compiler will throw an error. This is always true and why version control can be a pain sometimes.</p>
                    <p>Note: This is also why Java class names are capitalized and use camel case as a standard because the compiler doesn't care if a class begins with a lower case; it just makes sure the file name matches the class name. Convention dictates to capitalize class names in most languages.</p>
                    <p>Note: There is also a way to compile the .class files into a separate directory to keep the source code separate from executables.</p>

                    <h4>That should have been fairly easy, so onto actually writing some code.</h4>
                    <p>First thing would be to know about Java Data types as there are only two - primitives and pointers to objects. The first, primitives, are classically what you might think of as variables, integers, characters, boolean values are all primitives. The other, object references (pointers as I have been calling them), represent the vast majority of variable types used. Even String is an object, not a primitive.</p>

                    <p>A full list of primitives is below:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>boolean - true or false</li>
                        <li>int - from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1</li>
                        <li>short - -32,768 to 32,768</li>
                        <li>char - 16 bit unicode value. use single quotes.</li>
                        <li>float - 32 bit decimal number (use double most of the time)</li>
                        <li>double - 64 bit, decimal number</li>
                        <li>long - 64 bit, -2^63 to 2^63 - 1</li>
                        <li>byte - 8 bits, from -128 to 127</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Everything else is a refence (pointer). Even Strings.</h4>

                    <h4>Onto another topic: Operators</h4>
                    <p>Operators are present in all languages I know of though sometimes in different forms. They are very similar to mathematical operators with some variations.</p>

                    <p>The list of common operators in Java:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><pre><code>=   is the operator for assignment</code></pre></li>
                        <li><pre><code>+   is for mathematical addition or string concatenation</code></pre></li>
                        <li><pre><code>-   is for subtraction</code></pre></li>
                        <li><pre><code>*   is for multiplication</code></pre></li>
                        <li><pre><code>/   is for division</code></pre></li>
                        <li><pre><code>%   is the modulus which returns the remainder</code></pre></li>
                        <li><pre><code>.   is for accessing the object</code></pre></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The order of operation is at a default from left to right. Multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction. Assignment is one of the lowest predences.</p>

                    <p>Note: there are other operators, such as ++ or ?</p>
                    <p>Additionally, some of these operators can be combined, such as += which will add first the value on the right to the variable then assign it to itself.</p>
                    <p>A more explicit definition of above would be: x = x + 1, is the same as x += 1</p>

                    <h4>Logical Operators</h4>
                    <p>The logical operators return true if the evaluated statement is true or false if it is not.</p>
                    <p>The standard greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, less than or equal to are present.</p>
                    <p>For example <span class="emphasize">(3 > 2)</span> would return <b>true</b>. While <span class="emphasize">(3 < 2)</span> would be <b>false</b>.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, there is also <span class="emphasize">>=</span> for greater than or equal to, and <span class="emphasize"><=</span> for less than or equal to.</p>
                    <p>Judging equality is with <span class="emphasize">==</span></p>
                    <p>Note, all of these ONLY WORK FOR PRIMITIVES. Comparing objects is done with the .equals() method.</p>


                    <h4>Declaring variables</h4>
                    <p>Java is a strongly typed language meaning that the 'type' of the variable must be declared when the variable is declared.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <pre><code> int index;</code></pre>
                    <p>Simply declares an integer called index for further use.</p>
                    <p>Other examples:</p>
                    <pre><code> double bigNumber;</code></pre>
                    <pre><code> boolean didItWork;</code></pre>

                    <p>Note for chars: Chars must use single quotes when declaring a single character. Double quotes indicates a string. The converse isn't always true as 'this is a string' is a string.</p>

                    <p>Next, assignment of the variable to an initial value can take place in one step</p>
                    <pre><code> int index = 10;</code></pre>
                    <p>The index value starts at 10 instead of 0 (that is where integers begin).</p>
                    <p>It is a good idea to explicitly initialize variables in order to avoid silly mistakes.</p>
                    <p>Side note, when using numbers, typically only use integers and doubles. Floats, longs, and shorts have specific use cases for memory preformance but the difference between a 32 bit float versus a 64 bit double is not much. Changing a bunch of code from a float to a double would be.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Strings</h3>
                    <p>Strings are Object references in Java but are quite unique. In many ways Strings are treated like primitives in Java but they are not.</p>
                    <p>Take a look at how to assign a String below.</p>
<pre>
<code>
String name = "Bob";
</code>
</pre>

                    <p>This creates a new String Object with the value "Bob" in it.</p>

                    <h4 class="subject-header">String Concatenation</h4>
                    <p>String concatenation is the combination of two String Objects into one. For example, say you wanted to concatenate your fist and last names together.</p>
<pre>
<code>
String firstName = "Bob";
String lastName = "Goodname";
String fullName = firstName + lastName;
</code>
</pre>
                    <p>The value in the fullName variable is "BobGoodname" as the Strings have been mashed together. Note that the result isn't very readable to humans which is why use spaces, tabs, or commas to separate string values before outputting them.</p>
                    <h3 class="topic-header">Exercise</h3>
                    <p><a href="java/StubCode/LessonTwo/LessonTwo.java" download>Use this stub code.</a></p>
                    <p>Declare 4 variables in the main method.</p>
                    <p>Two integers called numberOne and numberTwo. Assign them 1 and 2 respectively.</p>
                    <p>A boolean variable set to false.</p>
                    <p>Finally, a String initialized with your name (eg: String name = "Bob";)</p>

                    <p>With your variables, called three print statements.</p>
                    <p>The first, call numberOne > numberTwo as a parameter</p>
                    <p>Second call the boolean value</p>
                    <p>Third, use String concatenation to combine "My name is: " combined with your 'name' variable.</p>
